1.The provided network can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of NSM. The NSM utilizes a 56-channel spiral array with the shifting interval of 0.9m.

2.File description
	56mic_3_train.pyï¼š training the model
	56mic_3_test.py: testing the model
	Unet_structure.py: providing the net block for '56mic_3_train'

	save_net_train: saving the trained network
	save_fig: saving the training MUSIC results
	mat: using the trained net to generate the covariance matrix

3.Running env:
	python 3.6.13
	tensorflow 1.14.0
	tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0
	numpy 1.19.5
	matplotlib 3.1.1
	h5py 2.7.0
	cudnn 7.6.5
	cuda 10.0.130

4.To train the model, just replace the variable 'dir_train_data'  in file '56mic_3_train.py' with the path of your own training data.
5.To test the model, replace the variable 'dir_test_data'  in file '56mic_3_test.py' with the path of your own testing data, and the variable 'save_dir_train' in file '56mic_3_test.py' with the path of your saving net.
6.The dataset can be downloaded from IEEE dataport with DOI: 10.21227/3mc6-hp62.
